Problem 3

The first snippet:

What does this snippet do?
Creates a horizontal bar graph, where the width represents the data. 

What is .bar? What is selected?
It is a class. All those (future elements) with the class "bar" is selected. 

Given that data is an array with [150, 230, 180, 90], what values do d and i take while this program executes. Why?
d: 150, 230, 180, 90
i: 0, 1, 2, 3
Because we pass use d and i as the argument names of the function, D3 will pass in the current datum into d and the index into i. 

What does append("rect") do?
This action creates the DOM elements, rectangles, and appends them. 

The second snippet:

What does this snippet do? How is it different than the previous one?
The end result of this snippet is the same as the previous one. It is slightly different because it creates three new variables. 

What do the variables bars, bars_enter and rects contain?
bars: contains nothing
bars_enter: contains an array of objects (empty placeholder elements) that are bond to the data
rects: contains an array of "rect" elements that are data-bond and now in the DOM
